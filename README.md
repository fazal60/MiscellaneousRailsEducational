A simple app developed using Rails, ReactJS and Apache Solr.  

Things you can do with it so far:

* Create an account

* Login to your account

* After logging in, you can see trending articles pulled off of New York times Article Search API.

* You can also search articles by writing text in the search box below Article panel.


## Future plan

* Index data into Apache Solr from NYT Books API to hold over 30,000 Books.

* Allow user to search Articles and Books.


NOTE: Will post installation steps shortly.
